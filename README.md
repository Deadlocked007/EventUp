# EventUp #
At Purdue University events occur almost every single day, only issue is a majority of students are not even aware of them. To even get a small amount of people to be aware of requires organizers to send Facebook invites, use different department mailing lists, put in ad requests for TV boards, etc. which in turns requires students to be part of/see one of them. “EventUp!” aims to solve this issue by providing organizers a centralized platform to advertise their event as well as allow students at Purdue a simple and reliable method of being notified of events.

### Project Objectives
- Address fragmentation of event sharing at Purdue University.
- Create mobile application that allows the listing as well as viewing of local events at Purdue University.
- Develop simple interface to allow organizers to post events along with related information.
- Develop simple interface for regular users to view events.
- Allow for event goers to check into and rate events.
- Allow for login by organizers to receive ratings and feedback from events.
- Create and configure Firebase database to be used to store information about events and other data.
- Create realtime heat map of current events.
- Allow for search of events based on metadata such as name, tags, location, etc.
- Add suggestions page with filters to sort by distance, number of people, etc.
- Create backend system to allow for push notification system to notify users of relevant events.
